Self driving 

detection methods

3 objects 

Cacti: dont hit em 
- they can be happy, sad, angry, evil 

Vehicles: SUV, truck, airplane

Traffic Signs: 55 different type

# what should we do 

three tasks 

1. traditional vision: detect and classify the three objects only them no subclass

2. Deep learning 
  traffic sign classification : probably some google resnet will be enough 
we can google some inspiratin for it 
some basic setup 
3. 3d vision 
  find the position based on relative to camera? 

hardcore tasks: first shouldn't be that hard 
deep learning: not sure what is it
